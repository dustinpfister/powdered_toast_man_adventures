<ul>
    
	<li><h3>main.js:</h3><ul class="todo">
	    <li class="done"> (2015.11.03) make reset upgrades button functional.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.11.03) make it so the upgrades menu can actually be used to set upgrades. </li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.11.02) add a level menu state, here the player will set the current wave they would like to play.</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.30) Got everything working again with the new version of slider.js</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.26) made changes so that the game will now use slider_20151026.</li>
	    <li>fix bug: The pause button in game state only slides in once then never does again</li>
		<li class="idea">Slider.addScene calls do not need to be places inside closure's for each game state. If this does not bother you find otherwise they can 
		be placed elsewhere including perhaps a separate file. </li>
	
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.21) gameOver state: there should be a display object that slides in that includes a congratulations or to bad message depending if there is a win or loss.</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.21) gameOver state: there should be a try again (loose) or next wave (win) button that appears on the menu rather than just the to game menu button</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.21) title screen: comment out how to play button for now. A how to play screen will have to be different for each level, so it does not belong there.</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.21) gamePaused state: add dispObject that will display the word paused that comes down onto the peace of toast</li>
		
	</ul></li>
	
	<li><h3>render.js:</h3><ul class="todo">
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.30) Got everything working again with the new version of slider.js</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.26) made changes so that the game will now use slider_20151026.</li>
		<li>Add a sprite sheet for rendering the sky, grass, and house.</li>
	    <li>Add the toaster that ptm jumps into</li>
		<li>Draw something to canvas when app is loading images to show the current progress.</li>
	    <li class="idea">Make ptm sprite sheet and use that in place of ctx.rotate to help improve preformance</li>
		<li class="idea">Place additional buildings, and objects other than the target.</li>
		<li class="idea">Add blast-off animation once ptm leaves the cooking state and enters launch state</li>
	    <li class="idea">Design a better interface that appears once ptm enters his flight state for basic flight mode, and others.</li>
		<li class="idea">Make better animation for when ptm jumps into the toaster</li>
	
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.21) I want sprites for the truck and plane in raisinBreath flight mode</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.21) I want the game over screen skinned so the player knows for sure if they won or lost.</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.20) Make drawing functions for each flightState in basic flightMode</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.20) Make drawing functions for each flightState in rasinBreath flightMode</li>
		
	</ul></li>
    
	<li><h3>ptm.js:</h3><ul class="todo">
	
	    <li>add a leveledUp property that is to be used to trigger a leveledUp application state</li>
	    <li>introduce flightPowerBurnRate property. Flight Power should burn at a per pixel rate, and should increase as wave increases. This burn rate 
		can be countered by investing logs into the flight power upgrade. This burn rate should also increase at a more intense rate for higher flight modes.</li>
	    
		<li>ptms position should be updated based on pixels per second (see demo)</li>
	    <li>flightMode raisinBreath: ptm.display.pitchRestrict should not be in the ptm.display object, it should be in a separate object</li>
		<li>flightMode basic: This new interface should show the pitch range for ptm</li>
		<li>flightMode raisinBreath: This new interface should show the pitch range for ptm</li>		
		<li>flightMode raisinBreath: This new interface should show a button to switch to the stance mode</li>		
		<li>flightMode raisinBreath: when in stance mode an interface should appear showing that the player can touch in any direction around ptm 
		to fire his raisin breath in that direction</li>
		<li>flightMode raisinBreath: the interface that displays the distance between the plane and truck should be more than just a number, 
		a mini map of some kind would be nice</li>
		<li>add a ptm cooking state that he enters once in the toaster, this should apply to basic and rasinBreath modes so far.</li>
		<li>have flight mode &#34;clinger&#34; working for level &#34;cling tenaciously!&#34; (ptm fly's backwards, you control a guy on his back) </li>
		
		<li>make levels unlock-able</li>
		
		
	    <li class="idea">wave 31 is used as a means to know that they player has won a log when completing wave 30 for the first time. If you no longer wish to 
		award logs for completing a wave for the first time, or use a different system to keep track, be sure to change this.</li>
		<li class="idea">flightMode raisinBreath: the pitchRestriction should be a value that changes as a result of upgrades or wave advancement</li>
		<li class="idea">The reverences to each Box class instance can be get once in the new game method that is called once, as long as such objects are not 
		created and deleted on demand.</li>
		<li class="idea">flightMode raisinBreath: what about the kitten? that is another object that I might want in the map, unless I just recognize that if the 
		truck reaches the other side of the map the kitten got hit, and the player lost.</li>
		<li class="idea">how about a &#34;freeRange&#34; mode?</li>
		<li class="idea">how about a &#34;crazyFlyer&#34; mode? The idea is a mode where ptm is actually AI controlled, but the player can suggest a direction.</li>
		<li class="idea">how about a &#34;GCTMT&#34; (Ground Control to Major Tom) mode? ptm stays in launch mode and just keeps flying up into space.</li>
		<li class="idea">how about a &#34;platform&#34; mode?</li>
	
	
	    <li class="done"> (2015.11.03) ptm.findLevel : formula for finding next level needs work, they player jumps way to many levels way to fast</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.11.03) add xp, and level system for ptm</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.11.03) added onWin functions for each flightState, place any code that should be done on a flight mode win there (such as awarding XP)</li>	    
	    <li class="done"> (2015.11.03) (ALERT! comment addressed) flightMode Basic: moved ptm starting x, and y declarations into ptm Box class constructor call, however i did have to leave the box class heading 
		deceleration in the ready state tick function, it needs to be there to set back heading when transitioning back from the barDrag state.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.11.03) fix bug: where final wave is can not be won on flight mode basic.</li> 
		<li class="done"> (2015.11.03)fix bug: where log is not award to player when when wave 30 is completed for the first time.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.11.03) fix bug: There is a bug where the remaining logs is not figured when the player enters the upgrades menu. </li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.11.03) add an logsRemaining property, and a method called findRemainingLogs that finds logsRemaining.</li>
	    
	    <li class="done"> (2015.11.02) ptm.playWave property added to indicated current wave to play for current flightMode</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.11.02) ptm.fmConfig.wave: this value should be able to be set to a value from 1 to the highest unlocked value</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.31) ptm.fmConfig.wave: this value should start at 1 and incress by 1 each time the player wins a wave</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.31) ptm.fmConfig.wave: this value should have a max value of say 30 for each flight mode.</li>
		
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.31) add upgrades</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.31) add waves for each level</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.31) have ptm.fmConfig.wave increase plane pitch restriction to say 80 if wave === 30.</li>
	
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.31) ptm.display renamed to ptm.fmDisplay</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.31) add a new public object called ptm.fmConfig, this will store information pertaining to the current flight mode that will change based on wave, 
		and upgrade settings. This will likely be the first step in introducing waves (that increase difficulty) and upgrades (depress difficulty). </li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.21) flightMode raisinBreath: fix bug: the controls for shooting the raisin breath are way off.</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.21) flightMode raisinBreath: have an interface that appears around the plane when it is hit. The interface should at least show the 
		direction to the truck</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.21) flightMode raisinBreath: find a good range of control for the pitch of the plane to make the difficulty just right</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.21) flightMode raisinBreath: apply flight power to help increase difficulty</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.21) flightMode raisinBreath: This new interface should show the current heading of the plane when it is hit.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.21) flightMode raisinBreath: This new interface should show the pitch range for the plane when it is hit.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode raisinBreath: the player should loose as soon as the distance between the plane and truck reaches zero. kitten or not 
		in the map it will always be to late when that happens.</li>	
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode raisinBreath: The player should be able to change the pitch of the plane when in the hit flightState. This control 
		will be needed to make the level allot less hard if the player must always hit the truck dead on. There should only be a 10-20 degree range 
		that the player can change, otherwise I might make it to easy.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode raisinBreath: for now rasinBreath flightMode is to easy, make it so that you have to hit the truck with the plane, rather then 
		just shooting it down before the truck gets behind the plane to the other side of the map.</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode raisinBreath: fix a bug where ptm shoots his raisin breath twords the pause button each time it is pressed when in the 
		stance flightState.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode Basic: have an interface that shows where to press to change pitch</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode Basic: make the area to press to change ptms pitch closer to ptm (within the radius of the new interface) </li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode Basic: make distance to target appear in interface that will be close to ptm</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode Basic: make a flight power meter rather than a number value, and have it as part of the interface</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode raisinBreath: This new interface should show the direction to the plane during flying state</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode raisinBreath: there should be an interface that appears around ptm durring the level out flight state.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.20) flightMode raisinBreath: This new interface should show where to press to change pitch</li> 
		
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.19) flightMode raisinBreath: I will want to have some kind of display that indicates the distnace between the plane and truck</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.19) add always state for each flightMode, place code that should be called on every frame tick regardless of flightState there.</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.19) Basic flightMode: create new house Box class instance to replace relevant properties in ptm object</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.19) raisinBreath flightMode: create new Box class instance to replace this.shot</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.19) raisinBreath flightMode: create new Box class instance to replace relevant properties in ptm object</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.18) basic flightMode: create new house Box class instance to replace ptm.target.</li>
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.18) There will likley need to be an array to store instances of the Box Class.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) one value of a Box class instance should be some kind of id like &#34;plane&#34;, &#34;house&#34;, ect that will be used to get a box class 
		instance when it is needed</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) I will ned a getBoxById method</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) There should be some kind of index that stores boxID's and index values to the coresponding boxID's in the array that sores Box class instances. 
		This will likely help improve performance compared to looping over the array each time.</li>
		
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) add a main closure that returns the ptm public object. Inside the closure place anything that does not need to be public.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) make it so each flightMode has a closure that contains at least one method or variable that does not need to be 
		public, or shared across other flight modes.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) fix glitch where ptm dos not appear when starting a new basic mode game after winning raisinBreath mode</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) make new game level: save the kitten. ( Make a plain crash into a truck to save a kitten. )</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) add a global onWin method that will preform certain actions that will always occur when the player wins (such as gaining a log, or xp points)</li>
		<li class="done">(2015.10.18) ptm.winLostCheck() : because I now have more than one flightMode, and the conditions that will lead to winning change between flight modes. 
		This method should be commented out and eventually removed. methods such as this should be part of a flightMode object, or becuase it does not need 
		to be public a closure within the flightMode object.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) have more than one flight mode working.</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) have &#34;rasinBreath&#34; flight mode working for level &#34;save the kitten!&#34;</li>
		<li class="done"> (2015.10.18) flightMode raisinBreath: flightState should always end in &#34;over&#34; state as long as thats how main.js knows a game has ended. This should apply to all flight modes actually.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li><h3>toaster.js:</h3><ul class="todo">
	    <li>toaster, and dial global variables should be combined into a single global variable, or this whole file should be combined into ptm.js</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li><h3>user_action.js:</h3><ul class="todo">
	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.18) ptm.pitch and toaster methods should not be called by user_action.js at all times. Instead it should call ptm.userAction, and ptm should
        handle such things for the current flightMode and flightState.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li><h3>api.js:</h3><ul class="todo">
	    <li>redesign your setUpConstructor method: sometimes I do not want all the properties that I assign to the argument object to be 
		part of a class instance, but to be used in the setup process when called with the new keyword. Maybe have a config propertie that is 
		ignored by the method?</li>
		<li class="idea">Becuase api.js is a file that you will cary with you to other projects, always look for code that should be placed in api.js. An 
		example of code that belongs in api.js is any code that can be writen in a reusable method form that will likely be shared across two or more 
		modules. If it is only really used in a single module, and nowhere else, than it should remain as a helper function within that module, do not place 
		it here.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li><h3>acetate.js:</h3><ul class="todo">
	    <li class="idea">consider adding method that returns the context of a given layer by sheetID, in some cased you may want to quickly get that.</li>
		<li class="idea">a sheets canvas drawing context should be the first argument in a draw method callback</li>
		<li class="idea"> The image repository system that you have should be removed from render.js and placed here in acetate.js. An Image repository is 
		an important part of any applaction that depends on one or more external image files, and is not application specific.</li>
		<li class="idea">Remember that this is a file that you will carry with you to other projects, as such apply all that you know that should be done 
		when working with such a file. </li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li><h3>map.js:</h3><ul class="todo">
	    <li>viewPort global variable should be consolidated into map variable, and all necessary changes should be made to dependences that use viewPort </li>
	    <li>if you change the width, or height of the viewport it should effect stuff used with slider.js, ptm.js, render.js ect. In other words I should
		be able to change the viewport size, and not have everything go to hell.</li>
		
		<li class="idea">The Box class in ptm.js, and everything that pertains to it such as ptm.getBoxById should probibly be moved here to map.js. 
		Everything that has to do with that is somthing that I can see being useful in future projects.</li>
		<li class="idea">considering that map.js will likely become a file that you will carry on with you to other projects, consider looking into moving 
		code from application specific files such as ptm.js into map.js. That is if it can be done in a generic, modular way in which map does not depend 
		on any application specific dependency.</li>
	</ul></li>
	
	<li><h3>slider.js (if you need to make any changes do so in the main project folder) </h3><ul class="todo">
	        <li>the background plugin should update position based on pixels per second.</li>
	        <li class="done"> (2015.10.26) commented out a line that makes slider's Scene.user_action returns true when if finds a button that has been click, however this prevents any overlaping buttons 
			from getting clicked or activated.</li>
	        <li>make it so public functions can be append to slider.js by plug-in's</li>
	        <li>pull user-action, and event related stuff into a plug-in called slider_useraction.js</li>
	        <li>make it so the button class prototype can be appended to by plug-ins.</li>
	        <li class="done"> (2015.10.26) appendProps helper function was made more concise thanks to regular expressions</li>
	        Class instance, and the x, and y position where the user pressed.</li>
	        <li>The plug-in slider_canvas has been made but the background draw function should be pulled into it. 
			Slider.getBackground().draw(img,ctx) : I do not like this being in slider.js, but maybe I need to make a separate file called 
			slider_canvas.js?</li>
	        <li>add a scene class reset method. This may be needed to fix a bug with the pause button only sliding in once in the game scene in main.js. 
	    	this medthod should reset the scene to its hard coded default state in the case that a slide out animation state is never done, or competed.</li>
	        <li> have a method for scene that can be used to change the type value of a button. You may want to be able to change a action type to a menu type,
	    	 when it comes to your level select buttons for example (level starts out locked, but can become unlocked).</li>
			<li>make a new plugin called slider_movedistnace that adds distnaceX, and distanceY properties to the Button class that are used by a new 
			button update method that woeks by dividing the given distances over maxFrames to find delta x and delta y. </li>
	        <li>new button type idea: how about a &#34;scene_changer&#34; type button. This type of button will slide given stuff out, and in after the slide 
	    	in animation. However it will not trigger the slide out animation. This type could prove useful if you want the scene to chnage up now and 
	    	then without having to create another separate scene.</li>
	        <li>fix bug: it is possible to activate two buttons at once while the slide out animation is running</li>
			
			<li class="idea">appendProps helper function: it is true that this function helps prevent the occurrence of redundant elements in 
			buttonDefaults, and sceneDefaults when adding in plug-ins that use the same properties. However just simply concating the plug-in arrays in is 
			only two lines of code, and the end result is that the default value will be whatever is set in the last plug-in. If you will start useing this 
			helper in any other module, then move it to api.js</li>
			<li class="idea">Can I deprecate the entire background object and turn it into a plugin that makes use of two buttons?</li>
			<li class="idea">Scene class: add a setMaxFrames method to have the option to redefine maxFrames, and have everything properly updated when doing so. </li>
	    	<li class="idea"> images : Although slider is not an image repository it should store information pertaining to what image to display to 
	    	skin a button, yet again so far that is something that can just be stored inside a closer or given as a literal within the button render 
	    	function so maybe this file is a done deal if you just know how to use it.</li>
	    	<li class="idea">images : in the case of animations the button class should store a value that has to do with the current frame index, It should also contain 
	    	other relevant values such as the number of frames. (this may not be needed)
	    	</li>
	    	<li class="idea">images : in the case of animations the button class should store a value that would likley be a boolean that indacates if an animation should 
	    	loop from the beginning or back to the beginning. (this may not be needed) </li>
	    	<li class="idea">Remember that this is a file that you will carry with you to other projects, as such make sure that it only depends on files that 
	    	will also be carried to new projects as well. As of this writing it looks like it only depends on api.js, thats fine if you can keep it that way.</li>
	
	        <li class="done"> (2015.10.25) background object and getBackground public method commented out, 
			and replace with new plug-in slider_linearbackground.js</li>
	        <li class="done"> (2015.10.25) when onAction, onEnd or any other kind of event callback is fired it should have access to the Scene 
			<li class="done"> (2015.10.24) addPlugin public method: make it so addPlugin checks for a property in the Button Class (or Scene Class) before appending it in 
			the event that two plug-ins are loaded that both use the same property.</li>
	        <li class = "done"> (2015.10.24) made a new plug-in called slider_swingin</li>
			<li class="done"> (2015.10.24) Button Class sx,sy,dx,dy have been depreciated from main static.js module, however they have been pulled into a new plugin 
            that adds that kind of functionality if desired called slider_staticdelta.js</li>
            <li class="done"> (2015.10.24) forFrame method changed : now you just simply set x and y in the forFrame method you define for the button class instance by 
			using the this keyword, you do not return anything.</li>
            <li class="done"> (2015.10.24) Make the only module level button update method the forFrame method, all other ideas should be abstracted away into plug-ins. 
			To do this I may need some kind of array of methods that are used to manipulate button values that is called by Scene.update. So slider.js 
			alone will just come with forFrame, and additional methods can be appended to the array by way of plug-ins.</li>
			
			<li class="done"> (2015.10.23) Scene.renderAll() has been commented out, and moved to slider_canvas.js plugin.</li>
    		<li class="done"> (2015.10.23) render and globalRender button properties have been removed from buttonDefaults and moved to slider_canvas.js plugin</li>
    		<li class="done"> (2015.10.23) buttonDefaults variable added as a way to append to the Button constructor by way of plugin</li>
            <li class="done"> (2015.10.23) made my first slider.js plugin slider_canvas.js</li>
            <li class="done"> (2015.10.23) PLUG-IN SUPPORT! added an addPlugin public method that will allow for the use of plug-ins to abstract away methods that have to do 
    		with rendering as well as a whole lot of other things</li>
    		<li class="done"> (2015.10.23) because of the bug that occurred with rendering, and because rendering the background is not so trivial I added a 
    		draw method to the background object. I don't like the idea of having a rendering function in slider.js, but it seems necessary for the moment.</li>
            <li class="done"> (2015.10.23)Becuase Button.userAction is never called directly, but from Scene.userAction why have the method at all? unless I find a reason why I 
    		need to bother the whole method will be comment out, and collision detection will be done in Scene.user_action.</li>
            <li class="done"> (2015.10.23) Button Class: Button.userAction: commented out condishonal that is redundant if method is called from 
		    Scene.user_action</li>
            <li class="done"> (2015.10.23) fix bug: everything flashes when the background starts over. (This had to do with the demo, and not the with slider.js) 
		    itself</li>
	        <li class="done"> (2015.10.22) added the option to add a delta method to the button class that allows manipulation of delta x and delta y</li>
	        <li class="done"> (2015.10.22) added the option to add a forFrame method to the button class that allows direct control of x and y</li>
	        <li class="done"> (2015.10.22) new button idea: add a 'dummy' button type that will help do away with DispObj class. Instead just have a button type that does not do anything  
		    when clicked, simple.</li>
	        <li class="done"> (2015.10.22) make a slider.js demo for making and testing significant changes to slider.js</li>
	        <li class="done"> (2015.10.22) have separate methods that are called on user action depending on button type such as event_action. I like this better than 
	    	using a switch, just directly call an appropriate method that calls the appropriate callbacks, and sets things in motion.</li>
    		<li class="done"> (2015.10.22) images : I am running into a problem with rendering that might be able to be resolved by storing a 
	    	function in a button class instance that contains a code that can be used to display the proper sprite inside a sprite sheet.</li>
    		<li class="done"> (2015.10.22) pass scene class instance to render function as second argument, this will enable me to use Scene.frame to 
	    	know the state of the animation. This can then be used in conjunction with other variables inside a closure to aid in more advanced animations</li>
    	    <li class="done"> (2015.10.15) add on action event callback support</li>
    		<li class="done"> (2015.10.15) have more than one button type.</li>
	    	<li class="done"> (2015.10.15) add additional button type that just directly calls an on action callback, and does not cause a slide out animation.</li>
